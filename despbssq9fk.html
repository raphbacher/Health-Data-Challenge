The goal of this challenge was to bring together different expertise areas and benchmarking a number of bioinformatics tools. The focus was on estimating the proportion and amount of cell types present in simulated biological samples using convolved DNA methylation including patient metadata. Several DNA methylation tools and statistical methods were explored to separate biological and technical sources and to deconvolute analysis.</div><div></div><div>TABLE 1 </div><div></div><div>FIGURE 1: Challenge results</div><div></div><h2 data-label="394034" class="ltx_title_subsection">Discussion on the choice of k</h2><div></div><h2>Importance of benchmarking the simulated dataset</h2><div>+ influences of&nbsp; various simulation parameters : sample size, gaussian noise, dirichlet variance, cell type genetic background, cofounding factors</div><div></div><div>FIGURE 3: Heatmap of&nbsp; method performances according to simulation parameters</div><div></div><h2 data-label="500098" class="ltx_title_subsection">Optimal combination of methods </h2><div></div><div>FIGURE 4: Evalution of thPerformance of methods combination</div>
