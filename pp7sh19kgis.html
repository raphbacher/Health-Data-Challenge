<h1 data-label="707101" class="ltx_title_section">Discussion</h1><div></div><div>The number of computational methods for the cell type inference based on DNA methylation data is growing steadily (see&nbsp;<b>Suppl. Table XX</b>).  This calls for a comprehensive, unbiased and &nbsp;exhaustive benchmarking  study. In recent years several benchmarking studies were performed&nbsp;(<b>Suppl.&nbsp;Table XX</b>).  However, these studies entailed unsatisfactory heterogeneity in the  extent and number of methods included, as well as the versioning of the  methods assessed. In the present Data Challenge we performed a pilot  benchmarking study, the main advantage of which was that&nbsp; data sets were  simulated by individuals who were not competing&nbsp; in the development of  solutions; therefore solutions were independent of generating  methodology.&nbsp;This work will lead to a more comprehensive benchmarking  project that follows a similar methodology but in a more structured  format.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="358253" class="ltx_title_subsection">Cancer heterogeneity deconvolution : suggested pipeline (??)</h2><div>+ discussion on results</div><div></div><div></div>
