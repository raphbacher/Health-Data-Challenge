The goal of this challenge was to bring together different expertise areas and benchmarking some bioinformatics tools.&nbsp;</div><div>of this challenge was on estimating the proportion and amount of cell types present in simulated biological samples using convolved DNA methylation including patient metadata. Several DNA methylation tools and statistical methods were explored to separate biological and technical sources and to deconvolute analysis</div>
