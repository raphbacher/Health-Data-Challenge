The focus of this challenge was on estimating the proportion and amount of cell types present in simulated biological samples using convolved DNA methylation including patient metadata. Several DNA methylation tools and statistical methods were explored to separate biological and technical sources and to deconvolute analysis, such as Non-negative Matrix Factorization, Surrogate Variable Analysis, Principal component Analysis, Latent Factor Models. Thirty-four people participated, coming from five different countries, all with different expertise, such as bioinformatics, applied mathematics, statisticians and computer-scientists. The participants were divided over multiple teams.</div><div></div><div>The organization set-up a platform where the starting matric</div><div></div><div>D = T * A</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The challenge existed of two parts, namely (1) </div>
